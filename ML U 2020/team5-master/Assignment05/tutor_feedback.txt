Hi team5,

Q1-

4- Not valid a kernel. The Gram matrix is not PSD.
6- Form Gram matrix again, it won't be symmetric.

Q2-

Gaussian kernel is obviously the right choice according to the visualizations. So I assume that's why other kernels are not included in grid search. In the cases where qualitative analysis is not enough/clear, quantitative methods like grid search will come in handy.
